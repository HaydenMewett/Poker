Had a lot of trouble figuring out how betting would work. I had to write the following test code as a console app to test the logic

class Player {
  constructor(playerName) {
    this.playerName = playerName;
    this.inPlay = true;
    this.isDealer = false;
    this.money = 100;
    this.isCurrentPlayer = false;
    this.finishedBetting = false;
    this.betAmount = 0;
  }

  placeBet(amount) {
    if (this.money < amount) {
      return false;
    } else {
      this.money -= amount;
      this.betAmount += amount;
    }
  }
}

let players = [];
players.push(new Player("Player1"));
players.push(new Player("Player2"));
players.push(new Player("Player3"));

let currentPlayer = 0;

function getNextPlayer() {
  currentPlayer = (currentPlayer + 1) % players.length;
  return players[currentPlayer];
}

function getHighestBet() {
  let highest = -1;
  for (let i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
    if (players[i].betAmount > highest) {
      highest = players[i].betAmount;
    }
  }
  return highest;
}

function isEndRound() {
  for (let i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
    if (players[i].inPlay && !players[i].finishedBetting) {
      console.log("Round not over yet");
      return false;
    }
  }
  console.log("Betting round over");
  return true;
}

// call this whenever a raise
function resetFinishedBetting() {
  for (let i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
    if (players[i].inPlay) {
      players[i].finishedBetting = false;
    }
  }
  console.log("Resetting betting flags");
}

function playerFold(player) {
  player.inPlay = false;
  console.log(player.playerName + " Fold ");
}

function playerCall(player) {
  player.finishedBetting = true;
  let diff = getHighestBet() - player.betAmount;
  if (diff > 0) {
    console.log(player.playerName + " Call " + diff);
    player.placeBet(diff);
  } else {
    playerCheck(player);
  }
}

function playerCheck(player) {
  // do nothing
  console.log(player.playerName + " Check");
}

function playerRaise(player, amount) {
  resetFinishedBetting();
  player.finishedBetting = true;
  let diff = getHighestBet() - player.betAmount;
  console.log(player.playerName + " Raise " + (amount + diff));
  player.placeBet(amount + diff);
}

let p;
p = getNextPlayer();
playerCall(p);
isEndRound();

p = getNextPlayer();
playerRaise(p, 10);
isEndRound();

p = getNextPlayer();
playerFold(p);
isEndRound();

p = getNextPlayer();
playerCall(p);
isEndRound();
